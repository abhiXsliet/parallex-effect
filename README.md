# Parallax Effect

This project demonstrates the implementation of a parallax effect using HTML and CSS. The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by providing a sense of movement between the background and foreground elements on a webpage.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills and knowledge gained during a [web development bootcamp](https://github.com/abhiXsliet/webDevelopment-Bootcamp) The parallax effect has been created as a way to apply the concepts learned in the bootcamp, utilizing the latest HTML and CSS techniques.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create the parallax effect:

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Getting Started

To view the parallax effect, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. 
3. Or Just [Click Here](https://abhixsliet.github.io/parallex-effect/)

## How the Parallax Effect Works

The parallax effect is achieved by moving different layers of content at different speeds, creating an illusion of depth and immersion. This effect is commonly used in modern web design to add visual interest and enhance user experience.

The project consists of multiple layers of content that move at varying speeds as the user scrolls through the webpage. Each layer is positioned using CSS and utilizes the `background-image` property to create the desired visual effect.
